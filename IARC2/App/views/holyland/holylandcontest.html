                    <li>Israeli mobile stations may move and change their location during the contest, into 5 different 'Areas', restricted to an operating time of at least one full hour per 'Area'.</li>
                    <li>The operation from each 'Area' gives that station the status of a different station with another call, thus giving additional contest points and multipliers.</li>
                    <li>To identify its different location / 'Area', those stations will change their call signs by adding a number after their prefix. For example 4X4JU will use 4X41JU, 4X42JU...4X45JU or 4X6JS will use 4X61JS, 4X62JS etc.</li>

        <h4>Explaining the Multipliers:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <label>The square system:</label><br />
                The country is divided geographically, by the Survey Department of Israel, into a grid system resulting in squares of 10 by 10 Kilometers. North to South coordinates are identified by numbers, while West to East coordinates are identified by letters. The square is defined through the combination of the relevant coordinates i.e. E14.</li>
            <li>
                <label>The Administrative System:</label><br />
                The country is divided into 23 administrative regions and regions are not multipliers!<br />
                Here is a list of the Regions and their respective abbreviations:<br />

                <label>The 'Areas' (multipliers):</label>
                An 'Area' (multiplier) is made up from the 10 by 10 km. grid reference square and the region. For example: F15TA, E14TA, H08HF. The 'Area' is the basis for the "Holyland Award" and the "Holyland DX Contest". For that purpose the 'Area' must contain land and only that land or any waterway in that 'Area' is considered to be the 'Area'.</li>
            <li>
                <label>Region Boundaries:</label>
                The region boundaries are drawn in an arbitrary manner so that often the 10 km grid reference square does cover more than one single region. For example, the square H08 lies partly in the region of Haifa, partly in the region of Hadera and partly in the region of Yizreel. As a result one may work, in the same square, three different Areas - H08HF, H08HD and H08YZ.</li>
