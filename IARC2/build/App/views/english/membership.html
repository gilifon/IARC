        <h4>Membership</h4>
        <p>
            Every licensed ham of age 17 or more is eligible of membership in IARC.<br />
            Additionally, the members committee can approve admission in a state of "friendship". An IARC friend can be for example someone who is not 17 years old yet, or is not a citizen of the state of Israel, or is a club station, or a corporate. A friend is eligible of most of members' privileges, notably except the rights to elect or be elected to IARC's institutes.<br />
